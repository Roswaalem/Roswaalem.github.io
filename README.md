1- Use ?

This website serves as a hub to all of my projects. Source code of every of them is available in my github repositories.

2- In coming features

I am currently working on a LoL tracker, an ACNH Checker and also some video games. It'll take times to be pushed because I want them to be in an advanced enough stage to be shown in public.

3- Who are you ?

I'm just a basic computer science student living in France, and I want to show brand new ways to make projects by sharing mine.
